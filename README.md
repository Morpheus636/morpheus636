# About
Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a high school senior (Shaker '24) with lots of hobbies and not enough time. I'm a student journalist, working as an editor for The Shakerite. When I'm doing that, I spend my spare time programming and maintaining open-source software, and volunteering for communities across the internet.

You can find out more about me, including my resume, portfolio, and full contact info, on my [website](https://morpheus636.com)
